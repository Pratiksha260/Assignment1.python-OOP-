    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    ANS:The goal of object-oriented programming(OOP) is to model real-world concepts as objects,which have attributes and methods.OOP allows for the creation of complex programs that are easy to understand,maintain, and extend.It also promotes code reuse by allowing object to be created from existing class templates.Object-oriented programming focuses on the creation of objects that contain data and behavior.The data is stored in variable called \"attributes\", and the behavior is defined by functions called \"methods\". These objects can interact with each other, and with the outside world, to achieve a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The primary goal of OOP is to create flexible, reusable, and modular code that is easy to understand and maintain.It achieve this by breaking complex problem into smaller, into manageable pieces, each of which can be encapsulated by an object.These objects than can be combined and reused in new programs, reducing the amount of code that needs to be written from scratch.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    OOP also promotes the concept of inheritance, where one class can inherit attributes and method from another class. This allows for the creation of hierarchies of related classes, each with their own specialized behavior.Inheritance can also be used to create polymorphism, where multiple objects can respond to the same method in different ways.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Overall, the goal of OOP is to provide a way to complex systems and problems in a way that is maintanable, adaptable,intuitive to changing requirements."

    "\n",
